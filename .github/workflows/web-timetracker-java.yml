# This workflow has been DISABLED for this repository
# 
# Original: Build and deploy JAR app to Azure Web App - web-timetracker-01
# Reason: Repository is now using .NET 8 API (TimeTracker), not Java
# 
# This file is kept for documentation purposes.
# The old Java workflow configuration is replaced by:
#   - timetracker-deploy.yml (.NET 8 API CI/CD pipeline)
#
# This workflow now ONLY runs on manual trigger (workflow_dispatch)
# It does NOT run automatically on push to main.
